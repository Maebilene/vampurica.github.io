# Brujah
    #### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agitators, Punks, Rebels

The vampires of the Brujah clan were once scholars and seekers of wisdom. They would travel in search of the wise and solve the problems of the common man through logic. They once ruled the ancient great city of Carthage, where it was rumored that vampires and mortals could live together in peace. [Ventrue](./Ventrue) treachery and the armies of ancient Rome brought an end to Carthage however, shaking the Brujah to their core.

While the clan was historically composed of stoic philosopher-kings, the clan is now composed of passionate warriors and free-thinkers. Brujah feel mortal passions more deeply than other vampires, and are prone to hit first and ask questions later. They flock to all good causes, and are eager to act on anything they deem as injustice. Unfortunately their passions often cause them to lose themselves to their causes, ensuring that blood will flow and solutions always turn to violence.

Brujah are embraced from many cultures, regions, and religions. The Brujah are not very selective, and typically embrace individuals who have a strong drive to right wrongs. This makes Brujah apt at fitting in with the modern world, adopting to the style of rebellion.
