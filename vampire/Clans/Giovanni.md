# Giovanni
    #### Necromancers, Mafioso, Venetians

The Giovanni were initially a family of Venetian merchants under Roman rule, who had a strong interest in the powers of Necromancy. In 1005 Augustus Giovanni was embraced as a [Cappadocian](./Cappadocian) after making many deals to work together to study death with Cappadocius and his childer. Afterwards, Augustus Giovanni immediately started to embrace his own family members, creating a sort of Bloodline and cult within the Cappadocians for a period of time. This changed when Augustus Giovanni managed to Diablerize Cappadocius in 1444, gaining the full power of the Antideluvian, and ultimately striking a deal with the Camarilla to be recognized as a distinct clan while purging the remaining Cappadocians.

In recent years, the Giovanni have partnered with the [Setites](<./Followers of Set>) in order to establish the Independent Alliance in 2010. Since then, they have positioned themselves as not only the de-facto Necromancers for the world to contend with, but also as dealers of all items occult outside of the Camarilla. The Independent Alliance is currently being lead by a single-blooded outsider, Francis Milliner, as the Shepherd of the Dead of the Eastern United States. Two childer of the notorious Ambrogino Giovanni, Lucretia Giovanni and Enzo Giovanni, both sit as other Shepherds of the Dead for the family.

# Weakness

All Giovanni have an excruciatingly painful kiss, causing mortals 3 points of damage for each point of blood drained instead of the standard 2. This causes mortals to yell and scream in pain of the bite rather than becoming overwhelmed with pleasure like other clans cause.
