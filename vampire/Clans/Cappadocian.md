# Cappadocians
    #### Clan of Death, Grave Robbers, Necromancers

Among the original thirteen vampire clans, the founder of the Clan of Death was unique, as he found the embrace as a unique opportunity to study the condition of death and unlife. The founder who the clan is named after, Cappadocius, used much of his unlife in study of undeath and the paths of necromancy. Considered a visionary by many, he was not a firm leader, letting his favored childer control the clan. This changed when Cappadocius chose to purge his clan, which had grown quite numerous, in an event known as the Feast of Folly.

After the Feast of Folly, Cappadocius sought assistance in the study of death and unlife, choosing to work with a family of Venetian necromancers, the [Giovanni](<./Giovanni>). Embracing Augustus Giovanni would become the undoing of the clan however, as he eventually betrayed Cappadocius and diablerized him. He then went on to reshape the clan in his own image, converting it into clan Giovanni.

In modern nights, the Cappadocian have been extensively hunted to extinction by the Giovanni. The few who have survived are primarily those who are descendants of Lazarus, one of Cappadocius's favored childer, who avoided attending the Feast of Folly. There still exist bloodlines of Giovanni who retain Cappadocian blood, the [Premascine](./Premascine), but they are not trusted by the greater clan. The only Cappadocians who remain in large number are the [Samedi](./Samedi), for the simple fact that they do not believe they are descendants of Cappadocius. Instead the Samedi believe that they are descendants of Baron Samedi, the Haitian Vodou Loa.
