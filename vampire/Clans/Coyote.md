# Coyotes
    #### City Gangrel, Invisible Chainsaws

The Coyotes are a bloodline of Gangrel who have taken to hunting in cities, where the disciplines they have permit them to quickly ambush their prey and escape. Other Gangrel gave them the moniker of Coyote, comparing them to the creatures who are well-suited to live in the wilderness but have instead adapted to an urban existence.

A large majority of the Coyotes are members of the Sabbat, known to embrace prolifically, but with short unlife expectancies from their sect. In modern nights, Ragnar the Black has taken the Justicar seat in the Camarilla permitting the bloodline to join with lessened penalties for being former members of the Sabbat.

# Weakness

With their connection to the animals of the forest, the ability to speak with them, to shapeshift into them, and live off the hardy land, each Gangrel has acquired one animalistic physical feature. This may be unique eyes, ears, scales, etc. This feature can be concealed by mundane or supernatural means, but always returns when they sleep.

Additionally, a Gangrel gains yet another beast feature each time they Frenzy that goes away when they sleep.
