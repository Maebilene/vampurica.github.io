# Tlacique
    #### Jaguars

Although still a part of the [Followers of Set](<./Followers of Set>), the Tlacique make up the majority of the clan across Central and South America. Thought to be descendants of other Followers of Set, the Tlacique worship Tezcatlipoca, the God of Darkness and Sorcery. They hold a lot of resentment towards the Camarilla and Sabbat, reaching all the way back to the arrival of the European vampires to the Americas, and their role in the collapse of the native society of mortals who worshipped them.

The Tlacique used to rule over the Aztec, Inca, and other native civilizations as bloodthirsty gods who demanded human sacrifice. When the European vampires first arrived in Mexico, they were initially accepted by the Jaguars, until the Spaniards began to destroy the native populations they controlled. They did not understand why the European vampires did not rule over mortals like they did, and sided with the Sabbat for some time to drive the Camarilla out of Mexico. Once the Sabbat had conquered much of the territory that belonged to the Tlacique, they turned on them as well.

The Tlacique are also known for their practice of blood rituals, a simplistic shamanistic method of applying blood to the body to get specific effects. The Sabbat took some of these practices from the Tlacique, but without the spiritual beliefs, it simple infuriated the Tlacique further.

In modern nights, the Tlacique are rare to see outside of their jungles, where they try to slip away from even vampire memory, after being heavily decimated by both the Camarilla and Sabbat.

Tlacique are a bloodline that require 2 merit points to play.
