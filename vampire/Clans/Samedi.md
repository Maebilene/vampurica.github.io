# Samedi
    #### Nation of Blood, Stiffs, Zombies

The Samedi bloodline, primarily hailing from the Caribbean, is unique in comparison to many of the other bloodlines. While most simply position themselves as offshoots from their parent clan, the Samedi instead reject the idea that they are descendants of the [Cappadocian](./Cappadocian). Instead, they consider themselves to be descendants of the Loa Baron Samedi, leading to the [Giovanni](./Giovanni) leaving them mostly alone.

Compared to the deathly pale [Cappadocians](./Cappadocian), the Samedi are even more repulsive. Unlike the [Nosferatu](./Nosferatu) who are terribly disfigured, the Samedi appear to be in a constant state of decay. Rotting chunks of flesh fall off their bodies as they age, and the smell of death follows them wherever they go.

The Samedi have expanded across the globe since their start in the Caribbean, and regularly embraces individuals who are obsessed with death, or are somehow connected to it. They tend to enrich themselves in occult circles wherever they go, finding dark corners to connect with others over their voodoo practices.
