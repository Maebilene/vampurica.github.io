# Fortitude
    #### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supernatural Resilience

Vampires are naturally tanky creatures after the embrace, being able to shrug off blows way more readily than mere mortals, but many vampires are true tanks. Feats of toughness that would astound even other vampires are the realm of Fortitude, granting the abilities for vampires to shrug off even the most agonizing pain as if it was nothing.

> "I once watched a Gangrel take a fall from a skyscraper and land on a Honda. That car looked like it had been steamrolled when they climbed out, shrugged, and walked off."

Each level possessed in this Discipline represents an additional level of supernatural resilience, with each power stacking on top of the previous power. For example, a character with the third level power of this Discipline will receive the benefits of that level, as well as all the levels below it, at the same time.

This is designed to allow for characters to soak damage from a single source. A character with the third level power of this discipline can use that power whenever they take damage to downgrade an [Aggravated Damage](../Core%20Mechanics/Health) to a [Normal Damage](../Core%20Mechanics/Health), and then use the second level power to ignore it, thereby soaking it. A character with the fifth level power in this discipline can soak up to two points of [Aggravated Damage](../Core%20Mechanics/Health).

Fortitude powers are always passively active unless otherwise specified, and do not require expenditure of blood or actions to activate unless specified. Refer to each individual power for specifics.

<h2>Focus</h2>

**Stamina**: Stamina focused characters gain 1 additional health level in each Wound Track when they first purchase Fortitude. A character meeting these requirements has an additional 3 total health levels.

<h2>Test Pool</h2>

Fortitude is generally a defensive discipline, and as such has no standardized test pool.

    <summary>**ELDER.** King of the Mountain - Passive</summary>
    ### King of the Mountain

    You do not move unless you want to move. Any method that would cause you to move against your will automatically fails. Powers and abilities that would force you to move on your own still succeed.

    In addition, if an opponent unsuccessfully uses a melee or unarmed attack against you, she moves 2 steps back from the point of impact. Characters who are thrown back and collide with a static object take 1 point of Normal Damage.

    <summary>**ELDER.** Personal Armor - ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸</summary>
    ### Personal Armor

    To activate Personal Armor, you must spend 2 Blood and a simple action.

    For the next hour, any time you are hit with a melee weapon or inanimate object, the object breaks against your flesh and becomes useless. Weapons destroyed by Personal Armor still inflict damage before they break, but cannot pierce your heart, preventing you from being staked.

    If you are struck with a Brawl attack, some of the force of that attack reflects back onto your attacker. The attacker applies their damage as normal to you, and then applies half of the total damage they are throwing (round up) back to themselves. The amount reflected back is the total before being reduced.

    Ranged attacks and attacks that do not actually touch your flesh, such as [Potence: Flick](./Potence#flick), are unaffected by Personal Armor. Wooden Projectiles still shatter before they can pierce your heart.

    You can spend 2 Blood to instantly heal 1 point of Aggravated Damage. This does not require an action to perform and may be done at any time even outside your initiative, like normal healing, but is restricted by your maximum expenditure of blood per round.

    In addition, whenever you spend a point of Willpower to retest a Mental or Social Power that attacks your sanity, such as Dementation or Mytherceria: Fiddlesticks, you immediately regain one point of Willpower.
