# Followers of Set
    #### Setites, Mesu Bedshet, Serpents, Tempters

The Followers of Set originate from Egypt where they claim that the founder of their clan was the Egyptian God of Darkness, Set himself (also named Sutekh). Now with global spread, the Setites are known for being the serpent in the grass. They position themselves out of the spotlight, offering people exactly what they need in order to bring them in an under their sway. Many view the Setites as corrupters, offering people vices and addictions, but to the Setites they are offering freedom from oppression. The truth is that the Setites often relocate to a new city and establish a cult that either conquers or succumbs to outside pressure.

The face of each cult, the Politian, the silver tongue, is someone whose job it is to sell you on what the cult has to offer. They are the converters who tell you all you could ever want to hear to get you invested in the cult solving your problems before you are even aware of the cult. The priest then guides you deeper into the cult, putting you through religious challenges of the cult before you are even aware you are being tested, to make sure you are worthy, known as the Gates of Revelations. If you are a viable candidate, you may be invited to join the Setite Church to take part properly. The final role is that of the soldier and guardian of the Cult, typically a [Viper](./Viper).

With the wide variety of spread among the intended roles within the clan, the creation of a cult that generates large amounts of influence over locals, and a range of access to various powers, the Setites have done well to operate as an independent clan. In joining with another large independent clan, they founded the Independent Alliance with the [Giovanni](./Giovanni) in 2010.

Like the founder of the clan, Sutekh, the Setites have a weakness to bright lights. They receive 1 point of additional damage of the appropriate type when exposed to sunlight, and take a -2 penalty to all their test pools while in bright light of any kind.
