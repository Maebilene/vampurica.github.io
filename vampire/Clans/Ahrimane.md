# Ahrimanes
    #### Valkyrjer, Sisters, Cats

During the Dark Ages a rare all-female bloodline of Gangrel known as Ahrimanes existed, headed by a woman named Ádísa. Legends say she was a Valkyrje and daughter of Freyja, the Norse goddess. She traveled far and wide, eventually gaining the attention of the Persian king Ahriman. He commanded her to fight for him, but she refused to be chained into his command, and was slain after fighting for three days against his massive armies. When Freyja came to take her daughter to Fólkvangr, she refused, loathing the king for his presumption and for waging a war against a single woman. So, Freyja taught her daughter how to speak to the spirits of animals, and she hunted the king for three days before taking his name from him as punishment.

After taking her vengeance, Freyja yet again came to take her, and she again refused. She said that her work was not over, as other women had been wronged too, and she would support them. She gathered these women and lead them until the clan was lost during the Long Night.

The Ahrimanes returned when Muricia, a Gangrel within the Sabbat, renounced both her sect and clan. She travelled to North America and studied the ways of the Native American Shamans, calling upon arcane powers to alter her vitae, unknowingly sparking a lingering trace of Ádísa's influence. After utilizing the thaumaturgic powers of the native shamans, she separated her blood from that of her clan, recreating the Ahrimane bloodline. Although never numerous, the Ahrimanes went silent in the late 1990s. That Sabbat seem to believe that Muricia lead her faithful on a pilgrimage somewhere into the other side, but nobody knows for sure.

# Weakness

With their connection to the animals of the forest, the ability to speak with them, to shapeshift into them, and live off the hardy land, each Gangrel has acquired one animalistic physical feature. This may be unique eyes, ears, scales, etc. This feature can be concealed by mundane or supernatural means, but always returns when they sleep.

Additionally, a Gangrel gains yet another beast feature each time they Frenzy that goes away when they sleep.
