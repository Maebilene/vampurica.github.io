# Anda
    #### Tartars, Mongrels

Legend goes that the Anda, a Gangrel bloodline, are descendants of the Mongolian earth goddess Itügen. Itügen was attacked by the bandit Wan Kuei who desired her, scaring off her husband and others, but her favored son Dobrul stood firm against him. Demons called forth by Wan Juei unleashed dark magic and hurled a stone of fire from the sky to smite Dubrul, but he survived. Though Dubrul lived, the curse of the Wan Kuei had changed him to desire mortal blood.

The Anda had a strong connection to their extended mortal families, giving them protection and assistance at night in exchange for them providing blood and safety during the day. This changed when Genghis Khan rose to power, as the Anda followed him and wiped out many of the Wan Kuei strongholds. Blows to the Anda came in the late 1300's when the Ming Dynasty and remainders of the Wan Kuei lead assaults against them, mostly wiping them out. It's uncertain how many, if any, remain.

Anda are a bloodline that require 2 merit points to play.

# Weakness

With their connection to the animals of the forest, the ability to speak with them, to shapeshift into them, and live off the hardy land, each Gangrel has acquired one animalistic physical feature. This may be unique eyes, ears, scales, etc. This feature can be concealed by mundane or supernatural means, but always returns when they sleep.

Additionally, a Gangrel gains yet another beast feature each time they Frenzy that goes away when they sleep.

The Anda have an additional weakness, being cursed not to remain in one place for too long. For each day that an Anda rests within the same five miles of where she woke, she must spend 1 additional blood to reawaken. This is cumulative, so an Anda who has slept within five miles of the same area must spend 4 points of blood to wake. This resets when she sleeps one day outside of the five mile radius. If the Anda does not have enough blood to awaken, she enters torpor.
