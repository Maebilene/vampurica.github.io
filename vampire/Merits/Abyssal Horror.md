# Abyssal Horror (3)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Lasombra Corsair](../Clans/Corsair))

Whether though long forays across the deepest, darkest depths of earth's seas or by association with creatures of the Abyss, some Lasombra have discovered the shape of the Kraken and are able to manifest that power within their own transformations. When a Lasombra with Abyssal Horror activates Black Metamorphosis, she may choose to assume a different form: Abyssal Horror. In this form, she retains the normal benefits granted by Black Metamoposis with several additional advantages.

When in Abyssal Horror form, a Lasombra's tentacles are more pronounced and much more numerous, granting the Reach quality to unarmed attacks made with them. In addition, she gains the ability to move through water at her normal movement speed, and if in the Abyss, to fly, hover and float as if swimming.

When in Abyssal Horror form, she may also spend both a standard and simple action in a round to perform an unarmed grapple combat maneuver against up to 3 targets in range (this grapple maneuver includes the Reach quality granted by Abyssal Horror, but requires paying the maneuver's willpower cost as normal). Spending a point of willpower to retest any of the challenges against her targets allows her to retest against all of the other challenges without spending additional willpower. She may maintain her grapple against these targets and attack them, as an exception to the rule prohibiting a character from attacking a character while maintaining a grapple on another character. These attacks count against the maximum amount of times a target can be attacked per round. Grappled characters may attempt to escape normally.
