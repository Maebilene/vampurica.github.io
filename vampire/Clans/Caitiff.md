# Caitiff
    #### The Clanless, Trash, Unbound

The Caitiff are not a clan in the general sense, but the absence of the defining features of a clan. Caitiff are wildcards, typically having not inherited the weakness of their Sire's clan, or any or all of the defining powers of their Sire's clan. These unfortunate vampires are usually abandoned as embarrassments to their Sires, considered unfit for vampire society.

Caitiff are in almost every vampire society shunned. In some Camarilla domains, they are even hunted and put to final death by the position of Scourge, as a twisted attempt to ward off the the end times outlined in The Book of Nod. The Book of Nod speaks to them as being an omen signaling that the eldest vampires will return and eat all their children as the world bathes in fire.

Caitiff vary wildly from one to another, each one an individual from every walk of life. No two Caitiff are the same. They may have been carefully chosen by their Sires, or been a botched embrace in a complete accident. Regardless, the circumstances of their embrace have left them on the fringe of vampire society.

The Anarch Movement has come to accept many of the Caitiff, viewing them as just another group of vampires who are oppressed by the Camarilla, so long as they earn their keep. The Sabbat have as well, after the famed Caitiff Joseph Pander established himself as the founder of a clan under his name within it.
