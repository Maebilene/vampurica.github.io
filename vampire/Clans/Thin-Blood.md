# Thin-Bloods
    #### Duskborn, Mercurians, Weaklings

In many ways similar to the Caitiff, the Thin-Blooded are vampires who due to no circumstances of their own have been embraced with thinner blood than other vampires. They do not have the hallmarks of a traditional clan, and are considered to be [Caitiff](./Caitiff). A vampires general power in many ways is related to how many embraces removed they are from the first vampire. Thin-Bloods are typically 14th or 15th generation, many steps further away from the first vampire than others, sired by a lineage of vampires who for some reason or another frequently embraced.

Just like the [Caitiff](./Caitiff), the Thin-Blooded are considered to be a sign of the end times, when the eldest vampires will rise to devour their children and the world will bathe in fire. Because of this, Thin-Bloods are almost universally shunned by other vampires. They are mysterious though weak, with there being rumors of some being able to reproduce, intense visions of the past, or even walk in the sun. Rumors abound about them having potentially dangerous powers and dubious loyalties, and many vampires rather just see them put to death to be safe.

In the strictest sense, the Thin-Blooded are defined by taking the [Thin-Blooded](<../Flaws/Thin Blooded>) Flaw. However, by definition, all Thin-Blooded are considered Caitiff. Thin-Blooded characters have many restrictions placed upon them as defined by the Flaw.

# In Clan Disciplines

Thin-Blooded begin play with three selections from the Disciplines below, unless altered by taken Merits.

[Animalism](../Disciplines/Animalism) — [Auspex](../Disciplines/Auspex) — [Celerity](../Disciplines/Celerity) — [Dominate](../Disciplines/Dominate) — [Fortitude](../Disciplines/Fortitude) — [Obfuscate](../Disciplines/Obfuscate) — [Potence](../Disciplines/Potence) — [Presence](../Disciplines/Presence)

# Weakness

Thin-Blooded cannot enter play with more than 1 dots in the Generation background. Thin-Blooded can still increase their Generation through diablerie. Thin-Blooded cannot teach their initial starting Disciplines.

The Thin-Blooded cannot Blood Bond others, nor create or sustain Ghouls. They start play with three in-clan disciplines, but only receive 2 creation points towards those Disciplines. They also cannot ever learn a Discipline past the 4th level.

Beneficially though, sunlight only inflicts Normal Damage rather than Aggravated Damage, and tests to resist Frenzy are done as if they have 1 less Beast Trait.

If a Thin-Blooded character ever increases their generation through Diablerie to the 13th Generation, they must exchange this flaw for the [Lesser Generation](<../Flaws/Lesser Generation>) Flaw and repay the difference with XP.
