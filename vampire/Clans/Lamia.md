# Lamia
    #### Gorgons, Drakaina, Medusas, Lilins

Legend has it that one of the childer of [Cappadocius](./Cappadocian), Lazarus, came upon the High Priestess of a cult who worshipped the Dark Mother Lilith. The High Priestess, named Lamia, impressed Lazarus with her skill and took him with her fierce beauty. He chose to embrace her, her childer ultimately becoming the warriors and guardians of their parent clan.

The Lamia are known to carry a disease within their bite, forcing them to feed sparingly to avoid unwanted attention. Typically acting as soldiers for other Cappadocians, the Lamia were predominantly women, who were embraced for being close with death or murder. They prefer to reside among the dead to prevent a potential outbreak of plague from their bite.

Lamia are a bloodline that require 4 merit points to play.

# Weakness

Lamia are carriers of the Seed of Lilith, a wasting disease that spreads from their bite. Any mortal who is fed upon by a Lamia becomes sick and may die. The victim must make a test (Physical + Survival vs Diff. 8). Those who fail die within one week. Those who survive the bite are sick for a few days before recovering.

The majority of Lamia choose to feed on animals as often as possible to avoid spreading their disease, but some have taken to relying on the blood of other vampires to persist.
