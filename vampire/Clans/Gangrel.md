# Gangrel
    #### Beasts, Outlanders, Loners

Gangrel, generally thought of as beast and hounds due to their use of [Protean](../Disciplines/Protean), are a clan of vampires who are very loosely organized and generally lead nomadic loner lifestyles. They are known to be formidable fighters, but their disorganization leads to each being generally out for their own causes. Gangrel often stick to wooded areas, choosing to hunt for game rather than mortals in most cases, and generally get along with nature more readily than the vampires who choose to remain in cities, among the prey they hunt.

When the Camarilla formed the Gangrel were signatories of the Treaty of Thorns, making them a pillar clan. This changed in the 1990s when a prominent member of the clan resigned from his position, Xaviar, Justicar of Clan Gangrel. Since then, the primary portion of the clan has resided outside of the Tower choosing to instead fend for themselves. Many Gangrel still remain within the Camarilla, but it is just as likely to find a Gangrel siding with any other sect.

Recently with the exit of the [Brujah](./Brujah) from the Camarilla following the Conclave of Hartford, the Camarilla has courted one of the bloodlines of Gangrel, the [Coyotes](./Coyote), giving them the pillar status that the core clan used to hold. Whether or not it was a good idea to invite the bloodline that formerly operated within the Sabbat into the Camarilla is questionable, but the Camarilla needed a new source of muscle. Considered to be one of the most numerous clans though uncounted, it's hard to not find a Gangrel around if you look hard enough.

# In Clan Disciplines

[Animalism](../Disciplines/Animalism) — [Fortitude](<../Disciplines/Fortitude>) — [Protean](<../Disciplines/Protean>)

# Weakness

With their connection to the animals of the forest, the ability to speak with them, to shapeshift into them, and live off the hardy land, each Gangrel has acquired one animalistic physical feature. This may be unique eyes, ears, scales, etc. This feature can be concealed by mundane or supernatural means, but always returns when they sleep.

Additionally, a Gangrel gains yet another beast feature each time they Frenzy that goes away when they sleep.
