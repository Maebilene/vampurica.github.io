# Gargoyles
    #### Grotesques, Rockheads, Runaways

Gargoyles are a Clan that were initially created in the 1100's by the [Tremere](./Tremere) using thaumaturgical rituals that would take other vampires and smash them together with no memories of who they were before the process. The newly created Gargoyles would then be forced into slavery under their master, both in combat and servant roles depending on their needs. This went on for many centuries until a mid-16th century revolt finally freed the Gargoyle clan. The creation of new Gargoyles by ritual was outlawed in 1489.

In general, the Gargoyles have an absolute hatred for the Tremere and are always looking for an opportune way to get the revenge they very much deserve. Although new Gargoyles are embraced, not created, the older Gargoyles are always certain to pass on the stories of their creation in order to fill their childer with the knowledge of the atrocities the Tremere committed.

# Weakness

The appearance of a Gargoyle is inherently masquerade breaching unless concealed via supernatural powers. A Gargoyle also loses all their memories of their mortal life when they are embraced.

Indoctrination under the Tremere remains in their blood, causing them to take a -2 penalty to resisting the powers of Dominate and Dominate-based techniques.
