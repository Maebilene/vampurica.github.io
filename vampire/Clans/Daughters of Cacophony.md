# Daughters of Cacophony
    #### Sirens, Sisters, Baritones, Banshees

The Daughters of Cacophony (also Sons of Discord or Children of Dissonance) are a bloodline of unknown origin, though many assume them to be descendants of [Toreadors](./Toreador) or [Malkavians](./Malkavian). The Daughters are not in a hurry to clarify this themselves though and become categorized, as keeping their true parent clan nebulous allows them certain freedom to choose one or the other when it is more convenient. What is common though is the ability of the Daughters to manipulate people with their voice alone.

The Daughters, who are typically embraced from singers of various backgrounds and walks of life, use their unique discipline of [Melpominee](../Disciplines/Melpominee) to throw their voice, imitate other sounds, captivate their audiences, and fill others with emotions. The highest skilled among them can even scream at such a sonic level as to deal damage to those who have the audacity to cross them or interrupt their performances.

Regardless, it is not uncommon for Daughters to be famous to the mortal world, giving performances at important events both mortal and vampire related.

# Weakness

One of the curses of being filled with song is that they constantly hear it. Every Daughter has unceasing music in their mind, which may be a particular song or genre. It distracts the Daughters as much as it guides and inspires them. They suffer a -2 penalty to all test pools based on [Investigation](../Skills/Investigation).
