# Introduction

Dark Skylines is a Vampire: the Masquerade game played inside [VRChat](https://vrchat.com/) using Live Action Roleplay rules and the [VRPG System](https://github.com/GIBGames/VRChatRPG).

In Dark Skylines, a troupe of over 40 players take part in an ever evolving plot revolving around the quarantined island they reside on, the artifacts contained within, and a powerful Ventrue who has cursed many aspects of it.

The year is 2053, where mega-corporations run rampant with corruption with gangs working as their muscle. As they slice up territory to claim for their own, how does vampiric society fight back?

Dark Skylines has multiple playable vampire factions including the Camarilla, Anarch Movement, Independent Alliance, and Sabbat. There are also playable creatures from Werewolf the Apocalypse, Wraith the Oblivion, and Changeling the Dreaming.
