# Giovanni Premascine
    #### Necromancers, Mafioso, Venetians

It is well known that the Giovanni gained their vampiric powers and additional skills in necromancy by Augustus Giovanni taking *the Bite* out of Cappadocius as the family refers to it. After this occurred in 1444, all the new Giovanni embraced under him experienced the curse of the painful kiss, causing agony to any mortals that were fed on. For those who were descended from lineages that were embraced a Giovanni before *the Bite* in 1444, they still show some of the hallmarks of being a [Cappadocian](<./Cappadocian>) descendant rather than a Giovanni.

The Giovanni Premascine exhibit a deathly pale complexion like their former parent clan, while still causing the painful kiss, but have the ability to learn the Cappadocian's primary path of necromancy, [Mortis Path](<../Disciplines/Mortis Path>). Because of the similarities to the Cappadocians, other Giovanni do not trust Premascine who were not embraced prior to *the Bite* in 1444, as they may still be loyal to the Cappadocians they are descendants from that the Giovanni has attempted to purge.

The Premascine is a bloodline that costs 4 merit points to play.

# In Clan Disciplines

[Dominate](../Disciplines/Dominate) — [Potence](<../Disciplines/Potence>) — [Sepulchre Path](<../Disciplines/Sepulchre Path>)

Additionally, a Giovanni Premascine can learn [Mortis Path](<../Disciplines/Mortis Path>) at out-of-clan costs without a teacher.

# Weakness

All Giovanni have an excruciatingly painful kiss, causing mortals 3 points of damage for each point of blood drained instead of the standard 2. This causes mortals to yell and scream in pain of the bite rather than becoming overwhelmed with pleasure like other clans cause.

Additionally, a Giovanni Premascine is deathly pale and suffers a Greater Status Ban in the Independent Alliance if they are known to have been embraced after 1444, under suspicion of being Cappadocians or Cappadocian Loyalists.
