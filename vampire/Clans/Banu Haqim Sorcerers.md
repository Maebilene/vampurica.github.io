# Banu Haqim Sorcerers
    #### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assassins, Assamites, Judges, Children of Haqim

The vampires of the Banu Haqim hail mostly from the middle east, centered around the hidden fortress of Alumut. With a reputation in the western world as assassins who follow a strict code of conduct, the Banu Haqim are varied across their bloodlines. The Banu Haqim Sorcerers are thaumaturges of the clan whose goals are caring for the Eldest, who has become more erratic over time, and getting vengeance against the [Tremere](./Tremere).

Banu Haqim Sorcerers are a bloodline that require 4 merit points to play.

# Weakness

Banu Haqim Sorcerers have issues using the powers of Obfuscate, as their aura shines with evidence of their inherent magical ability. Whenever a Banu Haqim Sorcerer is defending their Obfuscate from being pierced, their attacker recieves a +1 wild card bonus to their Auspex pool.
