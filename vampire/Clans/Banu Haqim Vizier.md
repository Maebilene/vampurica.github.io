# Banu Haqim Viziers
    #### Assassins, Assamites, Judges, Children of Haqim

The vampires of the Banu Haqim hail mostly from the middle east, centered around the hidden fortress of Alumut. With a reputation in the western world as assassins who follow a strict code of conduct, the Banu Haqim are varied across their bloodlines. The Viziers of the Banu Haqim were once responsible for archiving information of the world, until the religious schism of the clan caused them to defy the worship of Haqim and flee from Alumut. Because of this, the Viziers are considered traitors to their other clanmates, and are hunted by many of them.

Banu Haqim Viziers are driven to accumulate knowledge of the world with a zeal that borders on obsession. They are desperate for rare knowledge, and will do anything to uncover forbidden secrets. They are extremely focused in this goal even to their own detriment, acting irrationally and self-destructively in order to get their hands on what they want.

Viziers are obsessed with their research even to their own detriment. All Viziers have an Obsessive Derangement for *Uknown Knowledge*. They do not gain experience from this Derangement.
