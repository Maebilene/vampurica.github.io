# Abstract Awareness

## Cost: 1
## Restriction: Clan Specific ([Ravnos Brahman](../Clans/Brahman))

Through an intimate understanding of Maya, certain Ravnos are able to extend their Auspex powers to other planes of existence. When using the Auxpex power Heightened Senses, a Ravnos with Abstract Awareness is able to forgo the normal effects of Heightened Senses in exchange for a glimpse into either the Dreaming, the Shadowlands or the Umbra.

Looking into the Dreaming allows her to see chimerical entities, including the seemings of nearby changelings.
Looking into the Shadowlands allows her to see nearby wraiths.
Looking into the Umbra allows her to see nearby spirits, including shifters currently in the Umbra.

When looking into other planes, a Ravnos with Abstract Awareness can converse with the entities she sees there and make use of any of her Auspex powers. However, without the approprite lore specialiations, the entities she sees will appear foreign and indistinguishable.
