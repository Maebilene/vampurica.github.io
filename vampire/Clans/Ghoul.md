# Ghouls
    #### Retainers, Handlers, Servants, Minions

A Ghoul is created when a vampire feeds their vitae to a mortal without draining them of blood first like they would an embrace. This mortal stops aging, gains a little of the vampire's powers, and becomes extremely loyal to their Regnant, or master. Animals can be ghouled in the same way that mortal humans are with the same effects.

Ghouls are typically chosen and created with purpose, either for their profession or position, existing capabilities, or some other desirable quality of the moment that their regnant chose to feed them to exploit. Although almost every Ghoul starts with purpose, they often are eventually abandoned, being forced to seek the employ of another creature of the night or starve. Unfortunately for the Ghoul, vitae is incredibly addictive, and the withdrawal is not an easy one to handle. This leads to a small subset of Ghouls who consider themselves *freelancers* who provide services to vampires in exchange for vampire vitae.

For those who are unable to find a fix, they suffer the painful withdrawals, typically dying or losing themselves, or join up with vampire hunters afterwards.

# In Clan Disciplines

A Ghoul has access to the in-clan Disciplines of their Regnant.

# Weakness

A Ghoul is a semi-supernatural mortal and is considered mortal for all powers that interact differently towards mortals. They are considered to be part of their Regnant's clan and bloodline, and must pay all the rarity costs of their current Regnant's bloodline.

A Ghoul does not age or suffer illness, but if they do not drink from a vampire every 30 days, they age 10 years per day until they reach their natural age. For very old Ghouls, this is an extremely painful death sentence.

A Ghoul does not gain Beast Traits and cannot lose Humanity. They also cannot be on a path.

A Ghoul has a blood pool of 10 as all mortals do, but only 5 dots of this blood pool may be spent to activate supernatural abilities. This includes activating Disciplines, boost attributes, or heal as vampires can. Once these 5 dots of blood are spent, the Ghoul must feed on vampire blood again to regain access to them.

A Ghoul cannot take any dots in the Generation background, because they are mortal.

A Ghoul has access to the in-clan Disciplines of their Regnant, and can only learn powers that their Regnant already knows. They assign 5 Creation Points into these in-clan Disciplines, and can never increase Disciplines with XP. If a Ghoul cannot spend all 5 Creation Points, because their Regnant does not know 5 Discipline powers, they may save them and assign them later when they are able to. A Ghoul may never learn Elder Powers or Techniques, nor teach powers to others.

In order to change Regnants, a Ghoul must wait for their Blood Bond to their previous Regnant to fade from a 3 Point Bond to a 2 Point Bond. Afterwards, they can gain a new 3 Point Bond to a new Regnant, upon which they can choose to retain their former Regnants powers or switch to their new Regnants powers. If they choose to change, they must alter their sheet to match the Clan and Bloodline costs of their new Regnant as well as replace all of their former powers with the new ones they wish to take. None of the old powers can remain.

# Merits & Flaws

A Ghoul cannot purchase any clan-specific merits, except for the ones required to match their Regnant's Clan and Bloodline. A Ghoul cannot purchase morality merits, nor any merits or flaws that are specific to the vampire condition.

The Storyteller is the final arbiter of what is and isn't allowed for a Ghoul to take on their sheet.
