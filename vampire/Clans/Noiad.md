# Noiad
    #### Wanderers

A Gangrel Bloodline whose origin has been lost to time, the Noiad are a tribe from Scandinavia that were extreme isolationists. As the vikings drove them further north, they overfed more and more on their herd, ultimately leading to near extinction as a bloodline.

One of the few things that would bring the Noiad together was the *guovssahas*, when the Noiad would meet and watch the Northern Lights for messages from the gods, normally arranging the event through animal retainers.

# Weakness

With their connection to the animals of the forest, the ability to speak with them, to shapeshift into them, and live off the hardy land, each Gangrel has acquired one animalistic physical feature. This may be unique eyes, ears, scales, etc. This feature can be concealed by mundane or supernatural means, but always returns when they sleep.

Additionally, a Gangrel gains yet another beast feature each time they Frenzy that goes away when they sleep.
