# Absent Sway

## Cost: 3
## Restriction: Clan Specific ([Toreador](../Clans/Toreador))

Absent Sway allows a Toreador's art to instill an emotion or state of mind in all those who observe it. This art might be a fixture, such as a painting, sculpture or necklace; or a performance, such as a dance or song. The art must merely be sufficiently observable to impart its effect. For example, a blindfolded character would not be affected by a painting or dance.

A character who observes such art is not forced to act in any particular way, however, in order to act in a manner contradictory to the art's emotion, a character must spend 1 point of willpower to overcome its influence. Spending willpower in this way allows that character to ignore the effects of any Absent Sway for 1 hour. Absent Sway cannot affect individuals engaged in combat. Likewise, a character does not need to spend willpower to overcome the effects of Absent Sway if it would bring the character harm or would interfere with their self-preservation. This means that while a painting infused with a peaceful emotion may not stop fights, it may help prevent fights from starting in the first place.
