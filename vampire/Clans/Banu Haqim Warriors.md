# Banu Haqim Warrior
    #### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assassins, Assamites, Judges, Children of Haqim

The vampires of the Banu Haqim hail mostly from the middle east, centered around the hidden fortress of Alumut. With a reputation in the western world as assassins who follow a strict code of conduct, the Banu Haqim are varied across their bloodlines, the Banu Haqim Warriors being the reason for it. These warriors readily agree to dangerous missions, if paid well enough in blood. The Banu Haqim Warrior's taste for blood is legendary, as is their desire to judge vampires according to their founders laws. Violaters must be destroyed.

The Banu Haqim Warriors were once known as rampant diablerists, forced to stop when the [Tremere](./Tremere) intervened, performing a ritual that cursed their blood. Because of this, particularly old Banu Haqim hate the Tremere with a burning passion. When the leader of the clan rose to power, he broke the curse and swore the Banu Haqim to vengeance.

Banu Haqim Warriors are loyal to the mountain, and the eldest within Alumut. They will stop at nothing to hunt down and diablerize the traitorous [Banu Haqim Viziers](<./Banu Haqim>).

Banu Haqim Warriors are a bloodline that require 2 merit points to play.

# Weakness

Banu Haqim Warriors find the blood of other vampires highly addictive. When a Banu Haqim Warrior drinks vampire blood she gains 2 beast traits for the next 10 minutes. If she frenzies during this time, she will attempt to diablerize the last vampire whose blood she tasted. Unlike normal beast traits, these traits do not count when determining loss of Humanity.
