# Brujah
    #### Agitators, Punks, Rebels

The vampires of the Brujah clan were once scholars and seekers of wisdom. They would travel in search of the wise and solve the problems of the common man through logic. They once ruled the ancient great city of Carthage, where it was rumored that vampires and mortals could live together in peace. [Ventrue](./Ventrue) treachery and the armies of ancient Rome brought an end to Carthage however, shaking the Brujah to their core.

While the clan was historically composed of stoic philosopher-kings, the clan is now composed of passionate warriors and free-thinkers. Brujah feel mortal passions more deeply than other vampires, and are prone to hit first and ask questions later. They flock to all good causes, and are eager to act on anything they deem as injustice. Unfortunately their passions often cause them to lose themselves to their causes, ensuring that blood will flow and solutions always turn to violence.

Brujah are embraced from many cultures, regions, and religions. The Brujah are not very selective, and typically embrace individuals who have a strong drive to right wrongs. This makes Brujah apt at fitting in with the modern world, adopting to the style of rebellion.

In recent nights the clans de-facto position as enforcers within the Camarilla has changed. The highest representative of the clan within the Camarilla, the well-respected Justicar of Clan Brujah Theo Bell, met final death at the Conclave of Hartford after beheading the traitorous Ventrue Hardestadt. The legendary Brujah Romana Pendragon was then disrespected by the Ventrue Justicar Lucinde along with the other Brujah present who left in protest. This was solidified many months later when Romana Pendragon announced that she was joining the Anarch Movement, and declared the state of Connecticut an Anarch Free State. Needless to say, the Brujah then left the Camarilla in droves, and not many have remained.
