# Dhampir
    #### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half-Born, Revenants, Daywalkers

A Dhampir, once thought to be an impossibility, has become more common in recent nights with the rise of the [Thin-Blooded](./Thin-Blood). A Dhampir is a creature created from one vampire parent, typically the father, to a mortal mother. The existance of Dhampir proves that there are at least a few Thin-Blooded capable of reproduction. A Dhampir exists in a state halfway between life and undeath, which is extremely rare. Although Dhampir are typically treated like Ghouls, they have many differences.

Dhampir, being the children of the [Thin-Blooded](./Thin-Blood), are typically abandoned after birth, growing up with little knowledge of their parents or the extent of their powers. They are also common targets of a Camarilla Scourge, much like their progenitors.

Mechanically, a Dhampir character is created similarly to a [Ghoul](./Ghouls), with some changes.

# In Clan Disciplines

A Dhampir character has no in-clan Disciplines, and instead place 7 creation points into any three starting disciplines they choose. However, a Dhampir character can never learn any Discipline above the 3rd level.

# Weakness

A Dhampir must enter play with zero dots of Generation, and cannot increase it. Dhampirs are however supernatural creatures, not mortals like [Ghouls](./Ghouls). A Dhampir can never increase a Discipline above the 3rd level. Dhampir have no Beast, cannot Frenzy, and cannot purchase a Path Merit. A Dhampir cannot be embraced, and attempting to do so will kill them.

A Dhampir has 10 points of blood. Five points of this pool is supernatural, and the other five are mundane. They cannot learn Elder Powers or Techniques. A Dhampir can spend the supernatural blood in her pool at a rate of 1 blood per round.

# Clan Merits & Flaws

A Dhampir may take General Merits and Flaws that make sense for their condition.
