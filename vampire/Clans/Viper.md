# Vipers
    #### Warrior Setites, Horned Vipers, Serpents

It is rumored that a mortal who is embraced as a [Follower of Set](<./Followers of Set>) will gain the Disciplines the clan is known for, and that only the mortals who were trained as a Warrior from childhood to embrace become a Viper once turned. Instead of the stealth Discipline of [Obfuscate](../Disciplines/Obfuscate) that the parent clan learns to stay to the shadows, the Vipers instead gain [Potence](../Disciplines/Potence), the Discipline of supernatural strength. Where the other Setites prefer to remain out of the spotlight, the Vipers are proud and brutal soldiers for Set, willing to go into battle to back up their clanmates.

# In Clan Disciplines

[Potence](../Disciplines/Potence) — [Presence](<../Disciplines/Presence>) — [Serpentis](<../Disciplines/Serpentis>)

# Weakness

Like the founder of the clan, Sutekh, the Setites have a weakness to bright lights. They receive 1 point of additional damage of the appropriate type when exposed to sunlight, and take a -2 penalty to all their test pools while in bright light of any kind.
