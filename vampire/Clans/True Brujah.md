# True Brujah
    #### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sages, Truejah

While the Brujah are typically known for their fiery and rebellious natures, struggling to control their emotions, the True Brujah struggle to connect with theirs. The True Brujah claim that they are descended from the true progenitor of clan Brujah, who was much calmer and collected than the majority of the rest of the clan.

While the Brujah generally believe that their progenitor was Troile, the True Brujah claim that Troile was a methuselah that the Brujah Antideluvian embraced, who later diablerized him. They tought themselves as having the superior discipline of [Temporis](.,/Disciplines/Temporis) rather than the much more common [Celerity](.,/Disciplines/Celerity).

True Brujah tend to be very reserved and collected individuals in the face of most difficulties, commonly acting as academics and historians. They come together twice a century to share academic discussions, research, scientific treatises, and philosophical advancements.
