# Acute Sense (1)

### General Merit

A character with Acute Sense has one of their primary senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell or touch) honed to an incredible degree. When using this specific honed sense, she gains the effects of the Auspex power Heightened Senses. If she already has access to that power, then she gains the ability to activate Heightened Senses for that specific sense without paying any associated blood cost for that ability's effects. This merit can be taken multiple times to specialize in multiple primary senses.
